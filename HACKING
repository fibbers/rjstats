   This is a very basic document explaining how the components inside
   rjstats work together.

Syntax of rjstats files

   The whole idea behind rjstats was to monitor a network of linux
   servers. [8]rrdtool was the perfect job to do that, but it has a very
   difficult syntax, so writing each graph manually using rrdtool would
   be too time consuming. Therefore I slapped toghether a perl script
   which understands a more human readable syntax.

   Input for rjstats are plain text lines in a dot-seperated property =
   key format.

   First an example. To create a graph that has a red line at y-axis
   position 1 you would feed the following to rjstats:
   examples.redline.graph.title = A red line at number 1
   examples.redline.graph.unit  = number
   examples.redline.line.theline.value    = 1
   examples.redline.line.theline.color    = ff0000
   examples.redline.line.theline.type     = GAUGE
   examples.redline.line.theline.linetype = LINE1


   Every graph has a group and a name. These two must be unique. There is
   a "system" group where you can see cpu, memory and disk i/o usage, or
   a "bandwith" group where graphs for bandwith usage are shown.
   This means all property names start with group.name.

   After that there are 2 parts of a graph. one "graph" section and one
   or more lines, defined by "line"

   The graph has 2 properties: the title and the y-axis label.
   group.name.graph.title = Title of the graph.
   group.name.graph.unit  = bytes/second.


   After that you need to define lines in your graph. Multiple lines are
   possible. A line is in the form:
   group.name.line.nameofline.property = value


   The following properties are supported:
     * color - the color of the graph.
     * ignore - whether this line should be excluded
     * label - the label in the legend
     * limit - the maximum value of the line
     * linetype - One of rrdtools supported lines: AREA, LINE1, LINE2,
       STACK
     * type - the type of value: COUNTER, GAUGE
     * value - the value of the line now.

The files in this packages

   progs/* Where all the collector programs belonging to the package are
   installed.
   bin/rjstats This is where the magic happens. It parses rjstats
   property files and creates or updates graphs in the datadir. The
   datadir is the first command line option.
   bin/rjstats_fetch A convenience script to execute all collectors
   inside the progs directory as well as scripts located in
   /etc/rjstats/local.d and /usr/local/etc/rjstats/local.d.
   bin/rjstats_server
   bin/rjstats_send 2 files for transfering the output from rjstats_fetch
   over a tcp connection into rjstats on another computer. Used for
   monitoring entire networks.
