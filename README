Massive monitoring tool for linux.

REQUIREMENTS
============
- A computer with linux 2.4/linux 2.6/FreeBSD 5.
  Others might work but are not tested.
- rrdtool
- perl
- bash
- A webserver with php support.

Since the program is quite modular some collectors might require extra 
programs. We cannot collect mysql statistics if there is no mysql server
running.


INSTALLATION FOR A SINGLE HOST
==============================
Step 1: Fix the collectors
To install run the install script. Use install --prefix=/installdir to install
to /installdir. The install script will create a cron.sh file in the
installation dir.  Put this in a crontab to run every 5 minutes:
*/5 * * * * /tmp/rjstats/cron.sh

Step 2: Fix the viewing
The install directory contains a 'site' directory. Make this directory
accessible from your webserver. You might want to setup some security for
rjstats as well. Probably a symlink will work:
ln -s /installdir/site /var/www/rjstats

Step 3: View the graphs
Point your browser to the location you've made rjstats available for and you
should see a list of available graphs (Do this after the cron.sh entry has run).
Now get some coffee and wait for 30 minutes to get some real values in there.


## TODO
## INSTALLATION FOR A NETWORK
## ==========================
## It is possible to have 1 rjstats server where other computers send there 
## data to. Currently there is no form of security whatsoever so be warned.  At my
## work we run this setup on all our linux servers inside a private network where
## only company administrators have access, so we consider it secure enough. Do not
## put this on an internet accessible host unless you know what you're doing.
## 
## Step 1: Fix the server
## At this time it only works with xinetd. inetd is not supported. You will have to
## add an entry to /etc/services:
## rjstats 2500/tcp
## A xinetd config file is created in /installdir. Copy this file to your xinetd
## installation and restart xinetd. Check the logs for errors, if everything goes
## well xinetd is now listening on tcp port 2500. You might want to consider
## security at this point.
## 
## Step 2: Fix the collectors


TODO & BUGS
===========
- Make it portable to other unices(Only works on linux)
- Think of more things to monitor
- Add support for other rrd-functions then AVERAGE. (users should be MAX)
- Add change capability to rrd datastores. (now they can only be created or
  updated, if one changes you will have to throw away the graph)
