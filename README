1. Usage:

There are 2 modes of operation. One is for a local system and the other is as a
client-server setup.

1.1 Local system only:

set up a crontab that does 
$RJHOME/bin/rjstats_fetch | $RJHOME/bin/rjstats <datadir> <wwwdir>
every 5 minutes and you're done.

1.2 Remote system.
You need to setup an xinetd service for $RJHOME/bin/rjstats_server. An example
config file for xinetd can be found in $RJHOME/conf/rjstats.xinetd. After that
you need to run rjstats_send <server_ip> on each of your clients you want
statistics from.


2.1 Todo & Bugs.

- Make it portable to other unices(Only works on linux)
- Think of more things to monitor
- Add support for other rrd-functions then AVERAGE. (users should be MAX)
- Add change capability to rrd datastores. ( now then can only be created or
  updated )
